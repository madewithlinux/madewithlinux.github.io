    <a href="wiki/"><h1>Wiki</h1></a>
    <p>
        I now have a wiki. I'm planning to basically just fill this with various obscure stuff that I learn, that don't seem to have a place elsewhere.
    </p>


    <a href="blog/"><h1>Blog</h1></a>
    <p>
        I now have a blog. I put some stuff there, and then realized what I really need is a wiki. Because I'll want to update things as I go.
    </p>

    <h1>Recent projects</h1>

    <h2><a href="/timezones">timezones</a></h2>
    <p>
        It's a time zone visualizer.
        Because I find timezones to be difficult to think about.
        And I couldn't find an existing time zone app that did what I wanted, so I made one.

    <h2>whiteboard drawbot</h2>

        <br>
        AKA polargraph, polar plotter, etc.
        Designed and 3D printed by myself, with inspiration and concepts drawn from other's designs.
        The graphics code is <a href="https://github.com/madewithlinux/3d_printing/tree/master/gcode_making_scripts">written in python</a> (and is not very polished) and generates gcode to be executed by an unmodified ramps board running Marlin.
